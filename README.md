# Book and Quill Day Scheduler (Trilogy Skills Bootcamp: Week 07 - Challenge)

## Important Notes
As the course content this week was focussed on JavaScript, without directly editing the HTML or CSS files, I decided my personal goal for this challenge was to reflect what we had learnt by working purely in Javascript.

## Description
This week's task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day, by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I implemented the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.<a href="#references">*[1]*</a>

## Acceptance Criteria

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page.<a href="#references">*[1]*</a>
